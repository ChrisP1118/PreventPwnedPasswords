# Prevent Pwned Passwords

Prevent Pwned Passwords is a Chrome extension that helps make sure you don't use any password that's known to have been part of a data breach.

## How does it work?

To get started, install the Prevent Pwned Passwords from the Chrome Web Store.

Once installed, whenever you enter a password on any page, that password will automatically be verified against Have I Been Pwned, a service that keeps track of passwords that are known to have been compromised. If the password you enter has been in a prior breach, a notification will appear on screen.

While some people might like these constant reminders of bad passwords, you might find it a bit too naggy. There are a few options to better manage these notifications, which you can find by clicking on the Prevent Pwned Passwords icon:

* "Verify all password fields" is the default configuration, and checks all password fields.
* "Verify password fields when creating an account" will only verify passwords on page that look like they are for creating an account (or resetting a password). We can't always correctly determine these pages, but we look for pages that have two password fields (a password and a confirm field).
* "Verify password fields when I ask" doesn't automatically check any passwords. But you can right-click on any password field and choose "Has this password been pwned" from the menu to explicitly choose to verify a password. (This option is also available even if you also have password fields verified automatically.)
