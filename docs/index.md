# Prevent Pwned Passwords

Prevent Pwned Passwords is a Chrome extension that helps make sure you don't use any password that's known to have been part of a data breach.

## How does it work?

To get started, install the Prevent Pwned Passwords from the Chrome Web Store.

Once installed, whenever you enter a password on any page, that password will automatically be verified against Have I Been Pwned, a service that keeps track of passwords that are known to have been compromised. If the password you enter has been in a prior breach, a notification will appear on screen.
