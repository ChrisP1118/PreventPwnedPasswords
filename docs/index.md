# Prevent Pwned Passwords

Prevent Pwned Passwords is a Chrome extension that helps make sure you don't use any password that's known to have been part of a data breach.

## How does it work?

To get started, install the Prevent Pwned Passwords from the Chrome Web Store.

Once installed, whenever you enter a password on any page, that password will automatically be verified against Have I Been Pwned, a service that keeps track of passwords that are known to have been compromised. If the password you enter has been in a prior breach, a notification will appear on screen.

While some people might like these constant reminders of bad passwords, you might find it a bit too naggy. There are a few options to better manage these notifications, which you can find by clicking on the Prevent Pwned Passwords icon:

* "Verify all password fields" is the default configuration, and checks all password fields.
* "Verify password fields when creating an account" will only verify passwords on page that look like they are for creating an account (or resetting a password). We can't always correctly determine these pages, but we look for pages that have two password fields (a password and a confirm field).
* "Verify password fields when I ask" doesn't automatically check any passwords. But you can right-click on any password field and choose "Has this password been pwned" from the menu to explicitly choose to verify a password. (This option is also available even if you also have password fields verified automatically.)

## What should I do if I get a notification that my password has been in a breach?

You should change that password to something more secure.

## If my password has been in a breach, does this mean that I've been hacked?

No. What it means is that the password you used has been leaked in some prior data breach. It doesn't necessarily mean that your account was involved in a breach -- someone else could have used the same password as you. But because that password was leaked at some point by some site, it's much more likely to be compromised now -- so much so that you simply shouldn't use that password anymore.

## How do you keep my password safe?
