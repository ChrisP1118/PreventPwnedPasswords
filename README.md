# PreventPwnedPasswords
A Chrome extension that verifies passwords against Have I Been Pwned

This is somewhat a proof of concept at the moment.

Once this extension is installed, anytime you enter a password in Chrome, the password will be verified against Have I Been Pwned to see if it's ever been used in a breach.
